# Fabled10X — Content Architecture

**Document Version:** 1.0
**Created:** March 2026
**Purpose:** Complete content structure, pillars, series formats, and episode planning

---

## Content Pillars

Every piece of content maps to one of four questions:

1. **What can an AI agent team actually deliver?** (The Party Masters series — proof it works)
2. **How do you manage AI agents on complex projects?** (Tactical workflow content)
3. **How do you run this as a business?** (The consulting playbook — clients, pricing, delivery)
4. **What's the future of this model?** (SaaS expansion, scaling, industry shift)

---

## Content Tiers

### Tier 1: Flagship Series (Documentary)
Long-running narrative series following real project lifecycles. This is what people subscribe for, binge watch, and share. Establishes credibility.

### Tier 2: Playbook Series (Standalone)
Independent episodes on business mechanics and AI workflows. More searchable, more shareable. Brings new viewers into the ecosystem.

### Tier 3: Short-Form & Hooks
YouTube Shorts, TikToks, clips. Purpose: stop the scroll and drive discovery. 30-90 seconds, one sharp insight, strong opening line.

### Tier 4: Night Build Livestreams
Vibecoding livestreams. Late-night sessions building with AI agents in real time. Builds community, generates content for all other tiers, drives memberships and Super Chats.

### Tier 5: Community & Ecosystem Content
Office Hours, "Roast My Scope" community episodes, Stack Reviews, case study breakdowns from viewers who replicate the process.

## TIER 3: SHORT-FORM HOOKS

30-90 seconds, one sharp insight, strong opening line. Clipped from long-form or created standalone.

#### Building Party Masters / Consulting
- "My client's quote process took 30 minutes. My AI agents built a system that does it in 10."
- "I charged $34,500 for software I didn't code. Let me show you the proposal."
- "25 pieces of client feedback. 21 built in one sprint. Here's the action report."
- "This is the folder structure that runs a $30K consulting engagement."
- "There are 3,000 businesses in this niche and only 2 competitors. That's how I found my client."
- "The 10x developer isn't a myth. It just doesn't look like what you thought."
- "My client's network of 200 contacts is worth $400K in customer acquisition value."
- "This single feature — the quote builder — justifies the entire $34K investment."

#### The Fabled10X Pipeline
- "AI development is the wild west. I built 105 checkpoints so my agents can't cut corners." (→ P6)
- "Everyone's vibecoding. I'm running a TDD pipeline. Here's why my code ships and theirs doesn't." (→ P1)
- "This YAML file is the difference between AI that codes and AI that engineers." (→ P5)
- "I don't let AI write code until it's written every test first. Every. Single. Time." (→ P4)
- "Most people prompt AI to 'build a feature.' I prompt it to discover, specify, test, implement, refactor, and commit — in that order." (→ P6)
- "My AI agents get smarter every feature. Here's the knowledge base that makes it happen." (→ P7)
- "Nobody's teaching AI engineering. Everybody's teaching AI prompting. That's the problem." (→ P1)
- "The pipeline that built this website is also the content on this website. Let me show you." (→ P10)
- "I let AI build a feature with zero rules. Then I built the same feature with a spec. Watch." (→ P2)
- "3 habits. 5 minutes each. Your AI output will never be the same." (→ P3)
- "Better AI doesn't mean you need less process. It means you need better brakes." (→ P9, P12)
- "Every commit hash in this video is on GitHub. Every test count is real. Check me." (→ P10)
- "You're not behind. The entire industry is figuring this out right now. The window is open." (→ P12)
- "AI is confident, not correct. That's the sentence that changed how I build." (→ P1, P4)
