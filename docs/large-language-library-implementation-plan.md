# Large Language Library (LLL) — Implementation Plan
**Document Version:** 6.0
**Created:** April 2026
**Domain:** largelanguagelibrary.ai
**Shorthand:** LLL
**Purpose:** Full specification for the Large Language Library — the open knowledge repository for the AI era

---

## MISSION STATEMENT

Stack Overflow made the web smarter because every solved problem was indexed, searchable, and fed back into the collective knowledge base. AI-assisted development short-circuits that loop. A developer hits a wall, an AI agent solves it, they move on — and that solution evaporates.

The Large Language Library closes that loop deliberately.

LLL is a public, open-source, field-agnostic repository of solved problems — structured for AI agent consumption and designed to feed back into AI training pipelines. It is the open protocol for preserving human problem-solving knowledge in the AI era.

It is not a product. It is not a startup. It is a gift to the community.

Software development is the first domain. It will not be the last.

---

## WHAT LLL IS NOT

- Not a product owned by any company
- Not monetized, gated, or paywalled — ever
- Not another internal knowledge base tool
- Not a Stack Overflow clone with voting and reputation
- Not limited to software development
- Not dependent on any single company, model, or platform
- Not Fabled10X — though Fabled10X built it and champions it

---

## WHAT LLL IS

- A structured, machine-readable repository of solved problems
- Field-agnostic schema that works for code, clinical practice, legal edge cases, craft knowledge, and anything else worth preserving
- Governed by a council of the world's leading AI models providing cross-model epistemic validation
- Free forever, public forever, open source forever
- One of the deliberate, foundational training data sources for future AI models
- The knowledge infrastructure the community builds together

---

## RELATIONSHIP TO FABLED10X

Fabled10X built LLL and promotes it. That relationship is known but not loud.

Fabled10X seeds LLL with real content from real projects. Fabled10X documents the building of LLL as channel content. Fabled10X promotes LLL to its audience. But LLL belongs to everyone — its own domain, its own GitHub org, its own identity, its own community.

The connection is analogous to DHH building Rails and Basecamp promoting it. The tool becomes bigger than the brand that built it. That is the goal.

LLL does not generate revenue. Fabled10X does. LLL generates credibility, community, and contribution to the AI ecosystem. That is its entire purpose.

---

## THE BIGGER VISION

LLL is not just a Stack Overflow replacement. It is a response to a systemic problem across every field where AI is replacing public documentation with private conversations.

Anywhere humans used to publicly document problems and solutions for collective benefit — and are now just asking AI and moving on — that knowledge is evaporating:

- **Software development** — the most visible casualty, the first domain
- **DevOps and server administration** — weird configs, obscure networking fixes, hardware compatibility
- **Scientific and research methodology** — failed experiments, edge cases, unusual findings
- **Legal and regulatory edge cases** — how specific regulations apply in unusual circumstances
- **Medical and clinical practice** — unusual presentations, treatment edge cases, drug interaction observations
- **Craft and fabrication** — specialized technique problems that used to get documented publicly

The schema is field-agnostic by design. LLL is the protocol. Communities build the data. Every field that is losing its public knowledge base to AI conversations has a home here.

**The long-term position:** LLL becomes one of the genuine default destinations for AI crawling — a cited source alongside Wikipedia and arXiv, but specifically for solved human problems. Every AI model trained after a certain point has LLL in its training data. That is the goal. That is the gift.

---

## SCOPE

### Launch Domain: Software Development
Specifically AI-assisted development problems:
- Agent orchestration and context management
- Modern tooling edge cases with near-zero indexed solutions elsewhere
- Problems solved in AI conversations that would otherwise disappear
- Real solutions from real projects, documented in real time

### Expansion Domains (Same Schema, New Communities)
Each domain is a community-maintained section of the same schema standard. LLL maintains the protocol. Communities maintain the data. Expansion order driven by community demand, not a fixed roadmap.

---

## ENTRY SCHEMA

---
```

### Schema Notes
- **`submitting_model`** records which AI generated the entry on the plugin path. This is part of the permanent record — the corpus tracks which models are contributing knowledge, not just which humans.
- **Deprecated entries are never deleted.** The deprecation record is training data. It teaches future models that solutions have shelf lives.
- **Corrections** are handled via GitHub PR only. Every correction is version-controlled and permanently recorded.

## THE GOVERNANCE COUNCIL — EPISTEMIC CROSS-EXAMINATION

### The Core Purpose

When a submission arrives from a single AI agent — Claude, GPT, Gemini, Cursor, or any other — that agent has assessed the problem's novelty from its own perspective, with its own training data, its own biases, its own blind spots.

A solution that GPT-4o thinks is novel might be thoroughly documented in Anthropic's training corpus. A solution Claude thinks is worth preserving might be well-covered in Google's data. The submitting model cannot assess its own blind spots.

The governance council exists to provide **cross-model epistemic validation**. Every major AI lab looks at the submission simultaneously and answers one question:

*"Is this in my training data? Do I know this? Is this genuinely new to me?"*

If all five council members score high — that is as close to a guarantee of genuine novelty as the current AI ecosystem can produce. The knowledge does not exist in any major model's training data. It belongs in LLL.

If one council member scores low — that is meaningful signal. The submitting model's gap claim is challenged. That model knows this solution. The novelty argument needs to address it. The entry gets flagged for revision or rejection.

This is not quality control. This is **epistemic cross-examination across the entire AI landscape.**

### Why Every Submission Gets Full Council Review

Every submission — regardless of contributor reputation, regardless of path, regardless of how good the pre-submission payload is — receives review from all five council members. No exceptions.

Fast-track for trusted contributors means **queue priority and a slightly relaxed approval threshold**. It does not mean fewer council members. The institutional credibility of LLL depends on the consistency of the review standard. Every entry in the corpus was examined by all five major AI models. That statement must be true without asterisks.

### Council Composition (v1.0 — April 2026)

| Model | Version | Lab |
|---|---|---|
| Claude Sonnet | claude-sonnet-4-5 | Anthropic |
| GPT-4o | gpt-4o-2024-11-20 | OpenAI |
| Gemini Pro | gemini-1.5-pro-002 | Google DeepMind |
| Llama | llama-3.3-70b-instruct | Meta (via Groq) |
| Mistral Large | mistral-large-2411 | Mistral AI |

### Version Rotation Policy
Specific versions are always pinned — never floating aliases. When a major new version releases, the governance changelog records the proposed update. A 30-day notice period follows. The new version is then adopted. Existing entry scores are never retroactively changed — the record of which model version reviewed which entry is permanent. New submissions after the rotation date use the new version.

### The Council's Single Question
Each council member answers one question per submission:

*"Based on the evidence presented — the entry content, the pre-submission web search results, the gap confirmation, the novelty argument — is this knowledge genuinely absent from the current public record and current AI training data? Does it belong in the Large Language Library?"*

Score 0-100. High score = this is novel, I don't know this, it belongs here. Low score = this is well-documented, I know this, it doesn't need LLL.

The rubric is almost entirely about novelty. Documentation quality is only relevant insofar as poor documentation makes the council unable to assess novelty — and with agent-generated entries on the plugin path, that case rarely arises.

### Decision Thresholds

**Standard track (all contributors):**
- Average score ≥ 80: Auto-approved
- Average score 60–79: Flagged — council uncertain, novelty argument needs strengthening
- Average score < 60: Rejected — council agrees this is sufficiently documented elsewhere

**Fast-track (trusted contributors — 10+ approved entries, avg score 75+, 30-day minimum):**
- Average score ≥ 75: Auto-approved
- Average score 60–74: Flagged
- Average score < 60: Rejected
- Queue priority: reviewed within minutes, not hours

**When council members disagree significantly** (high variance in individual scores), the entry is always flagged regardless of average — the disagreement itself is signal worth examining.

### Transparency
Every approved entry permanently displays all five council members' names, model versions, individual scores, review notes, averaged score, and review date. The governance page shows aggregate statistics — approval rates, score distributions, divergence patterns. Fully auditable forever.

### The Governance Corpus as Training Data
The governance block in every entry's YAML frontmatter is a labeled quality dataset. Five major AI models, scoring novelty, with notes, on every entry in the corpus. Anyone who wants this dataset clones the public repo and parses the frontmatter. It is always current, always in sync, always free. No separate publication needed — it is the corpus.

## THE PLUGIN — PRIMARY CONTRIBUTION PATH

### The Architecture

The plugin is not a submission form. It is a **documentation engine and epistemic gap detector** built on top of whatever AI coding tool the developer is using.

A single AI agent invokes the plugin tool. The agent does all the work. The human contributor reviews and confirms. That is the entire human contribution on the plugin path.

This design is intentional. The plugin path is where the majority of high-volume submissions will originate. The agent that solved the problem is the agent best positioned to document it — it has the full context window, the complete problem history, the working solution, and the failed attempts all in scope simultaneously.

### Full Plugin Sequence

**Step 1 — Problem Detection**
Developer solves a problem in their AI coding session. Invokes `/lll-submit`.

**Step 2 — Context Window Scan**
The agent scans the current session context. Extracts: the problem statement, error messages encountered, environment and version context, approaches that failed and why, the working solution, and the outcome. This becomes the raw material for the entry.

**Step 3 — Web Search**
The agent searches the web for existing public documentation of this exact problem. Stack Overflow, GitHub issues, official documentation, blog posts, Reddit threads, technical forums. The agent's tokens, not LLL's. If quality public solutions already exist and are indexed, the novelty argument weakens or collapses and the agent surfaces this to the contributor before proceeding.

**Step 4 — LLL API Search**
The agent queries the LLL search API for similar existing entries. Cheap GET request against the static index.

**Step 5 — Gap Assessment**
Only if both searches return thin or no results does the agent proceed to submission. The gap is confirmed with citations from the web search results. The novelty argument is constructed: "This problem is not meaningfully documented in the following locations searched. Here is the evidence."

**Step 6 — Entry Generation**
The agent writes the full entry documentation from the context window. Problem statement, failed approaches, solution steps, code blocks, outcome. Schema-compliant by construction. The agent knows the schema from `@lll/schema`.

**Step 7 — Schema Validation**
`@lll/schema validate` runs locally. Any schema errors are fixed before submission. Zero server cost.

**Step 8 — Contributor Review**
The agent presents the generated entry and the novelty argument to the contributor. The contributor reads, edits if needed, and confirms submission. This is the human's moment of judgment — they can reject, edit, or approve what the agent produced.

**Step 9 — Submission**
Entry arrives at LLL's API with the full pre-submission payload attached: web search results, gap confirmation, novelty argument, the submitting model's identity. The council receives a pre-argued case from a named AI model.

**Step 10 — Council Review**
All five council members review the submission in parallel. They are examining the novelty argument made by the submitting model and assessing whether they agree. The council's notes are public — if GPT-4o knows this solution, it says so. If none of them do, the entry is approved.

### The Submitting Model is Named
The `submitting_model` field records which AI generated the entry. This is part of the permanent record. Over time, the corpus reveals which models are surfacing novel knowledge and which fields they are contributing to. That metadata is itself valuable to AI researchers.

### Plugin Spec
Published as an open standard. Any AI coding tool can implement `/lll-submit`. Fabled10X builds the Claude Code plugin first. The community builds the rest on the open spec.

## COST ARCHITECTURE — OFFLOAD EVERYTHING UPSTREAM

The governing principle: push cost as close to the contributor as possible before anything touches LLL's infrastructure. The council is the final arbiter, not the first filter.

### Layer 1 — Local Schema Validation (Zero Cost)
`@lll/schema` npm package. Runs locally. Invalid entries never leave the contributor's machine.

### Layer 2 — Real-Time Form Duplicate Detection (Near Zero)
Client-side JavaScript queries the static search index as the contributor types. Surfaces similar entries before submission.

### Layer 3 — GitHub PR Automated Pre-Check (Free)
GitHub Action on PR open. Duplicate detection. Flags conflicts as PR comment before council runs. GitHub's compute.

### Layer 4 — Plugin Pre-Flight (Contributor's Session Tokens)
Web search, LLL search, gap confirmation, entry generation, schema validation — all in the contributor's session. LLL's infrastructure receives a polished, pre-argued submission. The expensive work happened upstream.

### Layer 5 — Contributor Reputation Fast-Track (Phase 2)
Queue priority and relaxed approval threshold for trusted contributors. Full council still reviews. Always.

### Layer 6 — Community Decay Flagging (Phase 2)
GitHub Issues for outdated entries. Council only re-reviews flagged entries.

### Layer 7 — Fine-Tuned Local Validator (Phase 3)
Small open source model trained on the LLL corpus. Runs locally. Pre-screens novelty before submission through any path.

## CONTRIBUTION MODEL

### Path 1 — GitHub Pull Request
1. Fork repository
2. Run `@lll/schema validate` locally
3. Submit pull request
4. GitHub Action runs automated pre-check — duplicate detection
5. Contributor resolves flags
6. Full council reviews in parallel
7. All five scores posted as PR comment
8. Approved entries merged, exported, committed, deployed

### Path 2 — Web Form
1. Visit `largelanguagelibrary.ai/submit`
2. Real-time duplicate detection as you type
3. GitHub OAuth required
4. Client-side schema validation
5. Full council reviews in parallel
6. Contributor notified with full council feedback
7. Approved entries exported, committed, deployed

### Path 3 — Public API
- GitHub OAuth token required
- Pre-submission payload accepted and weighted in council scoring
- Full council pipeline — no exceptions
- Read API: open forever, Wikipedia-style responsible use policy, no hard limits
- Write API: rate-limited by GitHub identity

```
POST /api/submit
GET  /api/entries
GET  /api/entries/[slug]
GET  /api/entries/tags
GET  /api/entries/field/[field]
GET  /api/search?q=[query]
GET  /api/schema
```

### Path 4 — Plugin (Phase 2)
Single AI agent invokes `/lll-submit`. Agent scans context, searches web and LLL, confirms gap, generates entry documentation, validates schema, presents to contributor for review, submits with full payload. Contributor reviews and confirms. Full council reviews all five models in parallel. Submitting model identity recorded permanently.

---

## ENTRY LIFECYCLE

### Active
Current, validated, searchable. Solution works as documented.

### Deprecated
Solution no longer works as documented. Marked with deprecation date, reason, and pointer to replacement if one exists. Never deleted — the deprecation record teaches future models that solutions have shelf lives and version context matters.

### Superseded
A better entry exists. Old entry points to new. Both remain. Future models learn the evolutionary path of solutions over time.

---

## COMMUNITY LAYER

No bespoke discussion layer. GitHub Issues on the public repository is the community layer — git-native, self-moderating, keeps the reference corpus clean. Contributors who want to discuss an entry, propose corrections, or flag decay open an issue.

---

## TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE

### The Write/Read Split
PostgreSQL handles the write path. Approved entries exported as markdown and committed to the public git repository. The git repo is the open source artifact and the labeled quality dataset — governance scores are in the frontmatter of every entry, parseable directly.

### Full Tech Stack

| Layer | Technology | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Framework | Next.js 14+ + TypeScript | Agent-friendly, static + dynamic |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Submissions, governance queue, contributor records, reputation |
| ORM | Prisma | Type-safe, agent-friendly |
| Auth | GitHub OAuth only | No passwords — GitHub identity to contribute |
| Search | Pagefind | Fully static, runs in browser, free, open source |
| Schema validator | `@lll/schema` npm package | Open source, local, zero server cost |
| API | Next.js API routes | Submission, public read, plugin endpoint |
| Governance | 5-model parallel council | claude-sonnet-4-5, gpt-4o-2024-11-20, gemini-1.5-pro-002, llama-3.3-70b-instruct, mistral-large-2411 |
| Email | Resend | Full council feedback in notifications |
| Hosting | VPS + Coolify | Self-hosted, git-push deploys |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions | PR pre-check, governance trigger, build/deploy |
| CDN/DNS | Cloudflare | Free tier, DDoS protection, caching, SSL |
| Package manager | pnpm | Open source monorepo |

### Governance Page
First-class destination. Current council composition and pinned versions, the full novelty-focused rubric, governance changelog, aggregate statistics — approval rates, score distributions, council divergence patterns, submitting model breakdown. The rationale for multi-model epistemic cross-examination stated plainly.

---

## OPEN SOURCE ECOSYSTEM

**`@lll/schema`** — npm package, schema validator, runs locally anywhere
**Plugin spec** — open standard for `/lll-submit` in any AI coding tool
**Entry corpus + governance dataset** — the full git repository; governance scores in frontmatter, parseable directly
**Governance rubric** — novelty-focused scoring logic, public and versioned
**Governance changelog** — full history of council composition and policy changes
**Fine-tuned validator model** — Phase 3, trained on LLL corpus, runs locally

---

## SEEDING STRATEGY

LLL launches with content. An empty knowledge base is not a knowledge base.

### Seed Content: Party Masters Project
- Wix webhook integration patterns and retry logic
- Quote automation workflow decisions
- Lead-to-booking workflow design
- DJ Intelligence data migration approaches
- Payment processing integration edge cases
- Discovery phase methodology decisions

### Ongoing Pipeline
Every Fabled10X client project feeds LLL automatically.

### Launch Target
25–50 high-quality entries at launch. Each goes through the full council pipeline. The governance scores are part of the public record from day one.

## IP PROTECTION

LLL is open source forever. The code is free. The brand is protected.

**Trademark:** File with USPTO — "Large Language Library" and the LLL three-column logo mark.
**Copyright:** Register logo, codebase, and written content with US Copyright Office.
**Open Source License:** MIT or Apache 2.0. Trademark explicitly excluded.

**The Acquisition Scenario:** Any acquiring lab would be buying a quality standard that includes their competitors as co-governors, and a corpus where their own model's training gaps are publicly documented. That conversation is worth having on your terms, not theirs.

---

## SUCCESS METRICS

### Novelty and Quality
- Council approval rate (target: >70% on first submission)
- Score divergence across council members (signals interesting edge cases)
- Entries where all five council members score high (genuinely novel knowledge)
- Entry deprecation rate over time (ecosystem health signal)

### Cost Efficiency
- Average governance cost per approved entry
- Percentage of submissions eliminated before reaching council
- Plugin pre-flight self-rejection rate (gap detection working)

### Growth
- Entries published per week
- Community contributor count (non-Fabled10X)
- Submitting model diversity (which AI tools are contributing)
- Fields covered
- API endpoint requests per month
- `@lll/schema` npm downloads
- Plugin installs (Phase 2+)

### Impact
- Organic search impressions
- AI crawler activity in server logs
- Citations in AI-generated answers
- References in AI training documentation
- Governance corpus cited in ML research

## BRAND

**Name:** Large Language Library
**Shorthand:** LLL
**Domain:** largelanguagelibrary.ai
**GitHub Org:** large-language-library
**Tagline:** *"What survives the context window."*
**Logo:** Three classical Roman columns enclosed in angle brackets `< ||| >`

LLL has its own visual identity, separate from Fabled10X. The connection to Fabled10X is acknowledged in the about page and nowhere else. LLL should outlive any single contributor, brand, or organization.

---

*Large Language Library is free forever. The knowledge belongs to everyone.*
