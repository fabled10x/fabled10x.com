## Positioning

Every day, millions of problems are solved inside AI conversations that no one else will ever see. A developer hits an obscure Next.js edge case, Claude solves it, the developer ships and moves on — and that solution dies when the context window closes. The knowledge loop that Stack Overflow created — solve a problem, document it publicly, make the internet smarter — is breaking.

This series documents the building of the Large Language Library (largelanguagelibrary.ai): a public, open-source, field-agnostic repository of solved problems governed by a council of five competing AI models. It's the channel's most ambitious project — not a client build, not a tutorial, but public infrastructure for the AI era. Built on camera, from the first commit to the first community submission.

The hook: five AIs from five labs judging every submission for novelty. If even one of them already knows the answer, the entry is challenged. That's the innovation that makes LLL different from every knowledge repository that came before it.

### Target Audience

- Developers who've noticed that their best problem-solving happens in private AI conversations and disappears
- Open-source enthusiasts who want to contribute to something bigger than a framework or library
- AI researchers and ML engineers interested in cross-model epistemic validation and labeled quality datasets
- Technical founders thinking about what "public AI infrastructure" looks like
- Anyone who senses that the knowledge commons is shrinking and wants to help fix it

### What This Playlist Is NOT

- Not a tutorial on how to use LLL (that's the docs)
- Not a product launch narrative (LLL is not a product — it's a gift to the community)
- Not theoretical — every episode tracks real code, real API integrations, real council reviews, real costs

## Episode Plans

### ACT 1: THE PROBLEM

---

### L1 — "Knowledge Dies in the Context Window"

**Runtime target:** 15–18 min
**Pillar:** Future
**Search intent:** "Stack Overflow declining," "AI replacing documentation," "knowledge loss AI era," "why developers stopped posting solutions"

#### Thesis
The internet's knowledge loop is breaking. Stack Overflow made the web smarter because every solved problem was indexed. AI-assisted development short-circuits that loop — solutions are generated, consumed, and forgotten inside context windows that close forever.

#### Outline
1. **Cold open** (60–90s) — Screen recording: a developer asks Claude to solve an obscure Prisma edge case. Claude nails it. The developer ships. Session ends. "That solution just helped one person. It will never help anyone else. This is happening millions of times a day."
2. **The knowledge loop** (3–4 min) — How the internet used to work:
   - Hit a wall → search → find nothing → solve it → document it publicly → next person finds it
   - Stack Overflow, GitHub Issues, blog posts, forum threads — the public record grew with every solved problem
   - The incentive was social (reputation, upvotes) but the outcome was systemic (the web got smarter)
   - Show the Stack Overflow traffic curve — the decline is real and measurable
3. **The break** (3–4 min) — How AI changed the loop:
   - Hit a wall → ask AI → AI solves it → move on
   - The solution exists in a private context window, not the public web
   - No one documents it because the problem is already solved
   - The AI that solved it can't learn from it — the solution isn't in its training data
   - The next person with the same problem gets a hallucinated answer instead of a proven one
4. **Beyond code** (3–4 min) — This isn't just a developer problem:
   - DevOps: obscure configs, weird networking fixes, hardware compatibility notes — vanishing into private chats
   - Medicine: unusual presentations, drug interaction observations, treatment edge cases
   - Law: how specific regulations apply in unusual circumstances
   - Craft: specialized technique problems that used to get documented publicly
   - "Anywhere humans used to publicly document problems and solutions for collective benefit — and are now just asking AI and moving on — that knowledge is evaporating."
5. **The cost of inaction** (2–3 min) — What happens if the loop stays broken:
   - AI models trained on an increasingly stale public web
   - The same problems solved and re-solved in millions of private sessions
   - Expertise that used to compound across the entire profession now compounds only within individual context windows
   - "The irony: AI makes individual developers more productive while making the collective knowledge base less complete."
6. **Close** (60s) — "I'm going to build the thing that fixes this. Not as a startup. Not as a product. As a public resource that belongs to everyone. And I'm going to build it on camera, from the first commit."

#### Key visuals
- Screen recording of an AI solving a real problem in a private session
- Stack Overflow traffic chart (declining)
- The knowledge loop diagram: broken vs intact
- Field-by-field montage of knowledge types disappearing

#### Source materials
- docs/large-language-library-implementation-plan.md (Mission Statement, The Bigger Vision)
- Stack Overflow traffic data and developer survey trends
- AI usage statistics (percentage of developers using AI daily)

#### Shorts potential
- "Stack Overflow made the web smarter. AI is making it amnesia."
- "Your best debugging session helped one person — you. Then the context window closed."
- "Millions of solved problems. Zero public documentation. Every single day."

### L2 — "What If We Built the Solution?"

**Runtime target:** 15–18 min
**Pillar:** Future
**Search intent:** "AI knowledge base," "Stack Overflow alternative AI," "open source knowledge repository," "structured knowledge for AI"

#### Thesis
LLL is not a product pitch — it's a design problem. What would a public knowledge repository for the AI era actually need to look like? Machine-readable. Field-agnostic. Governed by something more rigorous than upvotes. Free forever.

#### Outline
1. **The design constraints** (3–4 min) — What the solution needs to be:
   - Machine-readable — AI models should be able to consume it directly, not scrape it
   - Field-agnostic — the same structure holds a Next.js edge case and a drug interaction
   - Governed — quality control that scales without human bottlenecks
   - Free forever — no paywall, no freemium, no "free tier with limits"
   - Decoupled from any single AI lab — can't be owned, acquired, or shut down by a competitor
   - "These constraints eliminate most existing approaches immediately."
2. **Why existing approaches fail** (3–4 min) —
   - Stack Overflow: human voting doesn't scale for AI-era volume. Reputation systems create gatekeeping. Not machine-readable by design.
   - GitHub Issues/Discussions: tied to individual projects. No cross-project knowledge graph.
   - Blog posts: unstructured, un-validated, SEO-optimized for clicks not correctness.
   - Internal knowledge bases: private by definition. The opposite of what we need.
   - AI training data: solutions are locked inside model weights, not queryable, not citable, not correctable.
3. **Introducing LLL** (4–5 min) — The Large Language Library:
   - A structured, machine-readable repository of solved problems
   - Every entry follows the same schema regardless of field
   - Problem, failed approaches, solution, outcome — the complete narrative of how a problem was actually solved
   - Governed by a council of five competing AI models — not upvotes, not human editors, not a single company
   - Free forever, public forever, open source forever
   - Show the tagline: *"What survives the context window."*
4. **The relationship to Fabled10X** (2–3 min) — Stated plainly:
   - "I'm building LLL. Fabled10X is documenting the build and promoting the result. But LLL belongs to everyone."
   - The DHH analogy: Basecamp built Rails. Rails got bigger than Basecamp. That's the goal.
   - LLL generates no revenue. Fabled10X does. LLL generates credibility, community, and contribution to the AI ecosystem.
5. **Close** (60s) — "Next episode: the governance model. Five AIs from five labs, reviewing every submission. It's the part that makes people do a double-take — and it's the part that makes the whole thing work."

#### Key visuals
- Design constraints listed as a checklist, eliminating existing solutions one by one
- LLL logo reveal: three classical columns in angle brackets `< ||| >`
- Architecture sketch: entries → governance → public corpus
- The DHH/Rails/Basecamp parallel graphic

#### Source materials
- docs/large-language-library-implementation-plan.md (What LLL Is, What LLL Is Not, Relationship to Fabled10X)
- Comparison matrix of existing knowledge platforms
- LLL brand assets (logo, tagline)

#### Shorts potential
- "Stack Overflow has upvotes. LLL has five competing AIs. Which one scales?"
- "I'm building a public knowledge base and giving it away. Here's why."
- "What survives the context window. That's the tagline. That's the whole project."

---

### L3 — "Five AIs Walk Into a Library"

**Runtime target:** 18–22 min
**Pillar:** Future
**Search intent:** "AI models reviewing each other," "multi-model AI governance," "AI council system," "how to validate AI knowledge," "Claude vs GPT vs Gemini comparison"

**GATEWAY EPISODE — designed for maximum discovery and shareability. The governance council concept is the most novel, immediately interesting idea in the project. This is the video people share.**

#### Thesis
When one AI says a solution is novel, that's an opinion. When five competing models from five different labs — each with different training data, different blind spots, different biases — all agree it's novel? That's as close to a guarantee as the current AI ecosystem can produce.

#### Outline
1. **Hook** (60–90s) — "Every submission to the Large Language Library is reviewed by five AI models from five competing labs. Claude, GPT-4o, Gemini, Llama, and Mistral all look at the same entry and answer one question: 'Is this in my training data?' If even one of them says yes, the entry is challenged. Here's why that matters."
2. **The blind spot problem** (3–4 min) — Why a single AI can't validate its own knowledge:
   - When Claude says "this is novel" — that means it's novel to Claude. Not to GPT-4o. Not to Gemini.
   - Each model has different training data, different cutoff dates, different indexing of the web
   - A solution GPT-4o thinks is novel might be well-documented in Anthropic's corpus
   - "The submitting model cannot assess its own blind spots."
3. **The council** (4–5 min) — How it works:
   - Five models, five labs: Claude Sonnet (Anthropic), GPT-4o (OpenAI), Gemini Pro (Google), Llama 70B (Meta via Groq), Mistral Large (Mistral AI)
   - Specific versions pinned — not floating aliases. claude-sonnet-4-5, not "latest"
   - Each model answers one question: "Based on the evidence — is this knowledge genuinely absent from the current public record and AI training data?"
   - Score 0–100. High = novel. Low = well-documented elsewhere.
   - Show the YAML governance block — five scores, five notes, permanently attached to every entry
4. **Decision thresholds** (2–3 min) —
   - Average ≥80: auto-approved — all five models agree this is genuinely novel
   - Average 60–79: flagged — council uncertain, novelty argument needs strengthening
   - Average <60: rejected — council agrees this is sufficiently documented elsewhere
   - When council members disagree significantly (high variance): always flagged — "the disagreement itself is signal"
5. **Why this matters** (3–4 min) — The deeper implications:
   - Transparency: every approved entry permanently displays all five scores. Fully auditable.
   - The governance corpus: five major AI models scoring novelty, with notes, on every entry in the public repo. That's a labeled quality dataset anyone can clone and study.
   - The acquisition scenario: any lab acquiring LLL would own a quality standard where their competitors are co-governors. "That conversation is worth having on your terms."
6. **Version rotation** (2 min) — How the council evolves:
   - When a new model version releases: 30-day notice, changelog recorded, new version adopted
   - Existing scores are never retroactively changed
   - The record of which model version reviewed which entry is permanent
   - "The council evolves. The record doesn't."
7. **Close** (60s) — "Five competing AIs from five labs, reviewing every submission. Not quality control — epistemic cross-examination across the entire AI landscape. That's the innovation. That's what makes LLL different from everything that came before."

#### Key visuals
- Council composition table on screen (five models, labs, versions)
- Animated sequence: submission arrives → five models review in parallel → scores appear → decision rendered
- Real YAML governance block (mock data for pre-build episodes)
- Venn diagram of training data overlap/gaps between models

#### Source materials
- docs/large-language-library-implementation-plan.md (Governance Council section — full text)
- Council composition table with pinned versions
- Decision threshold flowchart
- Governance corpus explanation

#### Shorts potential
- "Five competing AIs judge every submission to this library. If even one of them already knows the answer, it's rejected."
- "GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, Llama, and Mistral all review every entry. They're not checking quality. They're checking if the knowledge actually exists anywhere."
- "One AI says it's novel? That's an opinion. Five AIs from five labs say it's novel? That's a signal."
- "The governance data on every entry is a labeled quality dataset. Clone the repo and you have it."

### ACT 2: THE ARCHITECTURE

---

### L4 — "A Schema for Everything Humans Know"

**Runtime target:** 15–18 min
**Pillar:** Future (crosses into Workflow)
**Search intent:** "knowledge schema design," "structured knowledge base," "YAML schema documentation," "field-agnostic data model"

#### Thesis
The entry schema is the core intellectual contribution of LLL. Not a code schema — a knowledge schema. The same structure holds a Next.js edge case, a rare drug interaction, a legal precedent, and a metalworking technique. That universality is the design challenge.

#### Outline
1. **Why schema matters** (2–3 min) — "A knowledge repository without a schema is a blog. A schema without universality is a niche tool. LLL needs to work for software today and medicine next year. The schema is where that decision gets made."
2. **The entry schema walkthrough** (5–6 min) — Field by field through the YAML:
   - `id`, `slug`, `title` — identification and URL structure
   - `field` and `domain` — field-agnostic taxonomy (software | devops | medical | legal | craft | other → specific subdomain)
   - `problem.statement` — written the way someone would search for it
   - `problem.error_message` — exact error text, optional but powerful for search
   - `problem.environment` — OS, runtime, versions. Context that makes solutions reproducible.
   - `failed_approaches` — what was tried and why it failed. "This is the part most documentation skips. It's the most valuable part."
   - `solution.summary`, `solution.steps`, `solution.code` — the actual answer
   - `outcome` — what happened after applying the solution. Validated or not.
   - Show the full YAML on screen, walking through each section with a real example
3. **The pre-submission payload** (3–4 min) — The evidence layer:
   - `web_search_results` — what the contributor (or their AI agent) found when searching the web
   - `web_gap_confirmed` — yes, we searched, no quality public solution exists
   - `lll_similar_entries` — we checked LLL too, no duplicate
   - `novelty_argument` — the evidence-based case for why this belongs here
   - "The submission arrives pre-argued. The council doesn't have to do the research — it evaluates the evidence."
4. **Entry lifecycle** (2–3 min) — Active, deprecated, superseded:
   - Deprecated entries are never deleted. "The deprecation record is training data. It teaches future models that solutions have shelf lives."
   - Superseded entries point to the better entry but both remain. "Future models learn the evolutionary path of solutions."
   - Show the deprecation YAML fields: date, reason, superseded_by
5. **Field expansion** (2–3 min) — How the schema works for non-software domains:
   - Same schema, different `field` value
   - Walk through a hypothetical medical entry: problem (unusual drug interaction), failed approaches (standard protocol didn't work), solution (dosage adjustment + monitoring), outcome (patient stable)
   - "The schema doesn't care about the field. Problem, failed approaches, solution, outcome. That's universal."
6. **Close** (60s) — "Every knowledge repository that came before LLL was built for a single domain. LLL's schema is the first designed to hold solved problems from any field. That's either the most ambitious thing I've ever attempted or the most naive. This series will show you which."

#### Key visuals
- Full YAML schema on screen with color-coded sections
- Side-by-side: software entry vs hypothetical medical entry in the same schema
- Pre-submission payload flow diagram
- Entry lifecycle state diagram (active → deprecated / superseded)

#### Source materials
- docs/large-language-library-implementation-plan.md (Entry Schema, Schema Notes, Entry Lifecycle)
- Example entry YAML (software domain, from seed content planning)
- `@lll/schema` package design notes

#### Shorts potential
- "Problem. Failed approaches. Solution. Outcome. That schema works for code, medicine, and law."
- "Deprecated entries are never deleted. Deprecation is training data."
- "The most valuable part of documentation is what was tried and failed. Nobody writes that part."

### L5 — "Designing the Jury"

**Runtime target:** 15–18 min
**Pillar:** Future
**Search intent:** "AI model comparison," "multi-model AI system design," "AI governance architecture," "parallel AI API calls"

#### Thesis
The governance council isn't just "ask five AIs the same question." It's a designed system with pinned versions, a novelty-focused rubric, permanent transparency, and a version rotation policy that ensures the record is always interpretable.

#### Outline
1. **Why not just one model** (2–3 min) — Recap the blind spot argument, but now go deeper:
   - Each model has training data cutoff dates that differ by weeks or months
   - Each lab indexes different slices of the web, different open-source repos, different documentation
   - Fine-tuning and RLHF create unique knowledge profiles — the same base web but different emphasis
   - "Five models from five labs is the maximum coverage of the current AI knowledge landscape."
2. **The rubric** (3–4 min) — The council's single question, explained:
   - "Is this knowledge genuinely absent from the current public record and AI training data?"
   - Almost entirely about novelty, not quality. Documentation quality only matters if it prevents novelty assessment.
   - Score 0–100 with notes explaining the reasoning
   - Walk through what a high score looks like ("I do not have this in my training data, the web search confirms thin coverage, the solution approach is non-obvious")
   - Walk through what a low score looks like ("This is well-documented in the Next.js docs, here is the specific page")
3. **Version pinning** (2–3 min) — Why specific versions, not floating aliases:
   - `claude-sonnet-4-5` not `claude-sonnet-latest`
   - The score from a specific model version is meaningful. Floating aliases make scores un-reproducible.
   - When to rotate: major version releases trigger a 30-day notice → changelog entry → adoption
   - Existing scores are never retroactively changed. "The record of which model version reviewed which entry is permanent."
4. **The transparency commitment** (3–4 min) — Everything is public:
   - Every entry displays all five model names, versions, individual scores, review notes, average, and date
   - The governance page shows aggregate statistics: approval rates, score distributions, divergence patterns
   - The governance changelog records every council composition change
   - "Fully auditable forever. That's the standard."
5. **Why full council always** (2–3 min) — The fast-track temptation:
   - Trusted contributors (10+ approved entries, avg score 75+) get queue priority and a slightly relaxed threshold
   - They do NOT get fewer council members. Ever.
   - "The institutional credibility of LLL depends on one statement: every entry in the corpus was examined by all five major AI models. That statement must be true without asterisks."
6. **Close** (60s) — "The governance model is the hardest part of LLL to build and the easiest part to explain. Five AIs, one question, full transparency. Everything else is implementation detail."

#### Key visuals
- Council composition table with lab logos
- Score example: mock entry with five individual scores and notes
- Version rotation timeline graphic
- Governance page wireframe/mockup

#### Source materials
- docs/large-language-library-implementation-plan.md (Governance Council — full section, Decision Thresholds, Transparency, Version Rotation Policy)
- Council composition table (v1.0)
- Example high-score and low-score reviews (create mock data)

#### Shorts potential
- "Every model version is pinned. Not 'claude-latest.' claude-sonnet-4-5. Because scores need to mean something."
- "Trusted contributors get queue priority. They don't get fewer reviewers. Ever."
- "The governance page is a first-class destination. Not a footnote. Not fine print. A destination."

### L6 — "The Seven-Layer Cost Defense"

**Runtime target:** 15–18 min
**Pillar:** Future (crosses into Business)
**Search intent:** "AI infrastructure cost," "how to run AI cheaply," "multi-model API cost management," "open source AI project cost"

**TRANSPARENCY EPISODE — real cost architecture, no hand-waving about sustainability.**

#### Thesis
A knowledge repository governed by five AI models sounds expensive. It doesn't have to be. Seven layers of defense push cost upstream before anything touches LLL's infrastructure. The council is the final arbiter, not the first filter.

#### Outline
1. **The naive cost** (2–3 min) — What it would cost to run five model API calls on every raw submission:
   - Approximate token cost per council review (five models × input tokens × output tokens)
   - At 100 submissions per day, that's $X/month
   - "That's the number that makes people say 'this can't work.' They're right — if you do it naively."
2. **Layer 1: Local schema validation** (2 min) — `@lll/schema` npm package. Runs locally, zero cost to LLL:
   - Invalid entries never leave the contributor's machine
   - Missing fields, wrong types, malformed YAML — all caught locally
3. **Layer 2: Client-side duplicate detection** (2 min) — Pagefind search runs in the browser:
   - As the contributor types, similar existing entries surface
   - "Did you check if this already exists?" — answered before submission
4. **Layer 3: GitHub PR pre-check** (2 min) — GitHub Actions, free compute:
   - Automated duplicate detection on PR open
   - Flags posted as PR comments before council ever runs
5. **Layer 4: Plugin pre-flight** (3–4 min) — The biggest cost saver:
   - The AI agent does web search, LLL search, gap confirmation, entry generation, and schema validation in the contributor's session
   - The contributor's tokens, not LLL's
   - LLL receives a polished, pre-argued, schema-valid submission
   - "The expensive work happened upstream. By design."
6. **Layer 5: Contributor reputation** (2 min) — Phase 2:
   - Queue priority for trusted contributors (10+ approved, avg 75+)
   - Slightly relaxed approval threshold (75 vs 80)
   - Full council still reviews — always
7. **Layers 6 & 7** (2 min) — Community decay flagging (GitHub Issues for outdated entries) and fine-tuned local validator (Phase 3, small model pre-screening novelty before submission)
8. **The real cost** (2–3 min) — With all layers active:
   - Estimated percentage of raw submissions eliminated before reaching council
   - Effective cost per approved entry
   - "Free isn't costless. But it can be sustainable."
9. **Close** (60s) — "Seven layers. Each one reduces what hits the council. The principle: push cost as close to the contributor as possible. The council is the authority, not the gatekeeper."

#### Key visuals
- Seven-layer funnel diagram: raw submissions → approved entries, with cost eliminated at each layer
- Cost calculation table: naive cost vs layered cost
- Plugin pre-flight flow diagram showing where tokens are spent

#### Source materials
- docs/large-language-library-implementation-plan.md (Cost Architecture — all 7 layers)
- API pricing for all five council models (current as of recording)
- Estimated submission volumes and filtering rates

#### Shorts potential
- "Five AI models reviewing every submission sounds expensive. Here's why it's not."
- "The contributor's AI does the expensive work. LLL's infrastructure gets a polished result."
- "Layer 4 — the plugin pre-flight — is why this whole thing can be free."

### ACT 3: THE BUILD

---

### L7 — "Day One: Five API Keys and a Database"

**Runtime target:** 18–22 min
**Pillar:** Delivery (crosses into Workflow)
**Search intent:** "multi-model AI integration," "Anthropic OpenAI Google AI together," "parallel AI API calls Node.js," "Prisma PostgreSQL setup tutorial"

#### Thesis
Phase 0 begins. The first real technical challenge isn't any single integration — it's orchestrating five different AI APIs from five different providers with five different auth schemes, rate limits, and response formats into a single parallel council review.

#### Outline
1. **The starting line** (2–3 min) — What exists before this episode:
   - The implementation plan (632 lines of spec)
   - A domain name (largelanguagelibrary.ai)
   - A GitHub org (large-language-library)
   - Zero code
   - "Everything up to this point was design. This is where the building starts."
2. **Foundation** (4–5 min) — The boring-but-essential infrastructure:
   - Next.js project initialized with TypeScript
   - PostgreSQL + Prisma schema: submissions, contributors, council_reviews, entries, corrections, decay_flags, governance_changelog
   - GitHub OAuth — no passwords, GitHub identity only
   - Show the Prisma schema on screen, walk through the core tables
3. **Five APIs, five problems** (6–8 min) — The council integration layer:
   - Anthropic (Claude): Messages API, system prompt, structured output
   - OpenAI (GPT-4o): Chat completions, function calling
   - Google (Gemini): Generative AI SDK, different auth model entirely
   - Meta (Llama via Groq): OpenAI-compatible API, but not actually OpenAI
   - Mistral: La Plateforme API, its own SDK
   - Each has different: auth schemes, rate limits, response formats, error codes, timeout behavior
   - Building the abstraction layer: same input, same output format, five different implementations
   - "The council orchestration layer is the most important code in the entire project."
4. **Parallel execution** (3–4 min) — Making them run simultaneously:
   - `Promise.allSettled` — not `Promise.all`. If one model times out, the others still complete.
   - Timeout handling per model (different providers have different latency profiles)
   - Response normalization: five different response shapes → one governance score format
   - Error isolation: one provider's outage doesn't block the entire council
5. **The first test** (2–3 min) — A hand-crafted test submission through the council:
   - Write a seed entry manually
   - Feed it to all five models
   - Watch the scores come back
   - "This is the first time the council has ever reviewed anything. Five models, five scores, one submission."
6. **Close** (60s) — "Day one: a database, five API integrations, and a parallel orchestration layer. The council isn't just a concept anymore. It runs."

#### Key visuals
- Terminal recordings of each API integration being tested individually
- Split-screen: five terminal panels, five models responding in parallel
- Prisma schema on screen
- The first council review output — five scores displayed

#### Source materials
- docs/large-language-library-implementation-plan.md (Technical Architecture, Database Schema, Council Composition)
- Real Prisma schema from the LLL repository
- API documentation screenshots for each provider
- Terminal recordings of integration testing (capture during build)

#### Shorts potential
- "Five AI APIs. Five auth schemes. Five response formats. One orchestration layer. Day one."
- "Promise.allSettled, not Promise.all. If Gemini times out, Claude and GPT still score."
- "The first council review just happened. Five models, five scores, one submission."

### L8 — "The Council Is Live"

**Runtime target:** 18–22 min
**Pillar:** Delivery
**Search intent:** "AI reviewing AI output," "multi-model AI validation," "AI governance in practice," "AI council review demo"

**CENTERPIECE EPISODE — the first real council review session on camera. Five models score a real submission in parallel. The theory becomes a working system.**

#### Thesis
This episode is where the design meets reality. A real problem solved during a real project, submitted through the full pipeline, reviewed by five competing AI models in real time. This is the moment the council stops being a concept and starts being a system.

#### Outline
1. **Setup** (2 min) — "I'm going to submit a real entry from the Party Masters project through the full LLL pipeline. A problem I actually solved during the CRM build — a Wix webhook integration edge case that had no public documentation. Five models are going to review it simultaneously. I'm not going to edit the footage."
2. **The submission** (3–4 min) — Walking through the seed entry:
   - The problem: [specific Wix webhook edge case from Party Masters]
   - Failed approaches: what was tried and why it failed
   - The solution: what actually worked
   - Pre-submission payload: web search results (thin coverage confirmed), LLL search (no similar entries), novelty argument
   - "The entry is ready. The evidence is attached. Let's see what the council thinks."
3. **The review — live** (6–8 min) — Real-time council review:
   - All five models receive the submission in parallel
   - Show the terminal output as each model responds
   - Claude's score and notes: "Does Anthropic know this?"
   - GPT-4o's score and notes: "Does OpenAI know this?"
   - Gemini's score and notes: "Does Google know this?"
   - Llama's score and notes: "Does Meta know this?"
   - Mistral's score and notes: "Does Mistral know this?"
   - The scores come in. The average is calculated. The threshold is applied.
   - "This is the money shot. Five opinions from five labs on one submission."
4. **Reading the results** (3–4 min) — What the scores actually tell us:
   - Which models scored high and why — what does "novel to Claude but known to Gemini" mean?
   - The notes are more interesting than the numbers — each model explains its reasoning
   - What the variance tells us — high agreement vs high disagreement
   - "The governance block on this entry is now a permanent part of the public record."
5. **A second submission** (2–3 min) — Try one that the council should reject:
   - Submit a well-documented problem (something that's clearly in every model's training data)
   - Watch the low scores come in
   - "The council works in both directions. It approves what's novel and rejects what's known."
6. **Close** (60s) — "The council is live. Five models, five labs, one question, full transparency. Every entry in LLL will carry this governance record forever. This is what epistemic cross-examination looks like in practice."

#### Key visuals
- Full-screen terminal: five models scoring in parallel (the centerpiece shot)
- YAML governance block appearing in real time as scores arrive
- Score comparison chart: approved entry vs rejected entry
- The approved entry on the live site (or staging) with all five scores displayed

#### Source materials
- Real seed entry from Party Masters project (Wix webhook edge case)
- Terminal recordings of council review process (capture during build)
- Council output: all five models' scores and notes on the seed entry
- docs/large-language-library-implementation-plan.md (Seeding Strategy)

#### Shorts potential
- "I submitted a real problem to five competing AIs. Here's what each one said."
- "Claude scored it 87. GPT-4o scored it 92. Gemini scored it 78. Llama scored it 85. Mistral scored it 91. Approved."
- "I submitted a well-documented problem to the council. Five low scores in 30 seconds. System works."
- "The moment five AI models from five labs agreed: this knowledge doesn't exist anywhere."

### L9 — "The Three Doors"

**Runtime target:** 15–18 min
**Pillar:** Delivery (crosses into Workflow)
**Search intent:** "GitHub Actions automated review," "Next.js API routes," "real-time search Pagefind," "open source contribution workflow"

**PRACTICAL EPISODE — building all three contribution paths so anyone can submit.**

#### Thesis
A knowledge repository is only as good as its contribution paths. LLL needs to accept submissions from three sources: GitHub PRs for git-native contributors, a web form for browser-based contributors, and a public API for programmatic access. Each path feeds the same council pipeline.

#### Outline
1. **Why three paths** (2 min) — Different contributors have different workflows:
   - Open-source developers: fork → PR (git-native, familiar)
   - Occasional contributors: web form (low friction, instant)
   - AI agents and tools: API (programmatic, automated)
   - "All three converge on the same council pipeline. The contribution path differs. The quality standard doesn't."
2. **Path 1: GitHub PR** (4–5 min) — The git-native path:
   - Fork the repository, create an entry file, run `@lll/schema validate` locally
   - Push and open a PR
   - GitHub Action fires on PR open: automated duplicate detection, schema pre-check
   - Flags posted as PR comments — contributor resolves before council runs
   - Council reviews in parallel, scores posted as PR comment
   - Approved entries merged, exported, deployed
   - Live demo: create a PR, watch the Action run, see the council comment
3. **Path 2: Web form** (4–5 min) — The low-friction path:
   - `largelanguagelibrary.ai/submit` — GitHub OAuth required
   - Real-time duplicate detection as you type (Pagefind search, client-side JavaScript)
   - Client-side schema validation — errors caught before submission
   - Full council review after submission
   - Contributor notified with complete council feedback via email (Resend)
   - Live demo: fill out the form, see duplicate detection fire, submit, receive council feedback
4. **Path 3: Public API** (3–4 min) — The programmatic path:
   - `POST /api/submit` — GitHub OAuth token required
   - Pre-submission payload accepted and weighted in scoring
   - Rate-limited by GitHub identity
   - Read API: open forever, no auth required
   - `GET /api/entries`, `GET /api/search?q=`, `GET /api/schema`
   - Live demo: curl a submission, query the search API
5. **The export pipeline** (2–3 min) — What happens after approval:
   - Approved entries exported as markdown with governance scores in YAML frontmatter
   - Auto-committed to the public git repository
   - Pagefind re-indexes on deploy
   - "The git repo is the open-source artifact AND the labeled quality dataset. Clone it and you have both."
6. **Close** (60s) — "Three doors, one standard. Whether you submit via git, browser, or API, five models review your contribution. The path to contribution is easy. The standard for approval is not."

#### Key visuals
- Three-path flow diagram converging on the council
- Live terminal: GitHub Action running on a test PR
- Live browser: web form with duplicate detection firing
- API response showing council scores

#### Source materials
- docs/large-language-library-implementation-plan.md (Contribution Model — all three paths)
- GitHub Actions workflow files (pr-precheck.yml, governance.yml)
- API route implementations
- Web form screenshots/recordings (capture during build)

#### Shorts potential
- "Three ways to contribute. One standard for approval. Five AIs review everything."
- "The web form searches for duplicates as you type. Before you even submit."
- "Clone the repo. Parse the frontmatter. You have five-model governance scores on every entry. Free."

### L10 — "50 Problems Nobody's Solved (In Public)"

**Runtime target:** 15–18 min
**Pillar:** Delivery
**Search intent:** "open source seed content," "knowledge base curation," "AI project launch strategy"

#### Thesis
LLL launches with content. An empty knowledge base is not a knowledge base. Every seed entry goes through the full council pipeline — no exceptions, no shortcuts, no "founder's privilege."

#### Outline
1. **Why seed content** (2–3 min) — The cold start problem:
   - An empty repository signals "nobody uses this"
   - A seeded repository signals "there's value here, add yours"
   - But seeded content that skips the quality process signals "the process is optional"
   - "Every seed entry goes through the full council. If the council rejects my own seed content, the entry stays rejected."
2. **Selecting seed entries** (3–4 min) — What qualifies from the Party Masters project:
   - Wix webhook integration patterns — no public documentation exists for this specific retry logic
   - Quote automation workflow decisions — novel approach to multi-service pricing
   - Lead-to-booking workflow design — custom state machine for event management
   - DJ Intelligence data migration — platform-specific gotchas with zero public coverage
   - Payment processing edge cases — Stripe integration patterns specific to event-deposit workflows
   - Discovery phase methodology — how the paid discovery model actually works
   - "Not every problem from Party Masters qualifies. Some are well-documented. The council will tell us which."
3. **The seeding process** (4–5 min) — Running 25-50 entries through the full pipeline:
   - Write each entry against the schema
   - Run local validation
   - Submit through the API (the same path any contributor would use)
   - Council reviews each one — all five models, full scoring
   - Show real results: which entries passed, which were flagged, which were rejected
   - "My approval rate on seed content was [X]%. [Y] entries were rejected by the council. That's the system working."
4. **The rejections** (3–4 min) — The most interesting part:
   - Which seed entries did the council reject and why?
   - What did the council say that was in its training data?
   - Were the rejections correct? (Probably yes — the council knows more than I assumed)
   - "Showing you the rejections is more important than showing you the approvals."
5. **Close** (60s) — "50 seed entries. Full council review on every one. The governance scores are public from day one. LLL doesn't launch with hand-picked content. It launches with content that passed the same standard every future contributor will face."

#### Key visuals
- Seed entry list with pass/flag/reject status indicators
- Council scores on specific seed entries (approved and rejected)
- Terminal output: batch council review process
- Before/after: empty browse page → seeded browse page

#### Source materials
- docs/large-language-library-implementation-plan.md (Seeding Strategy)
- Actual seed entries from Party Masters project (capture during build)
- Council review output on seed content — approvals and rejections
- Final approval rate statistics

#### Shorts potential
- "I seeded my own knowledge base. The AI council rejected [X] of my entries. Good."
- "An empty knowledge base is not a knowledge base. But seeded content that skips review is worse."
- "The council rejected a seed entry I was sure would pass. Here's what GPT-4o knew that I didn't."

### L11 — "Launch Day"

**Runtime target:** 15–18 min
**Pillar:** Future
**Search intent:** "open source project launch," "AI knowledge base launch," "largelanguagelibrary.ai"

#### Thesis
The site goes live. Schema v1.0 published. `@lll/schema` on npm. The governance page is a first-class destination. This is not a Fabled10X product launch — it's an invitation to the community.

#### Outline
1. **Pre-launch checklist** (3–4 min) — Everything that needs to be true before going live:
   - 25-50 seed entries approved and published
   - All three contribution paths tested and working
   - Governance page live with council composition, rubric, changelog, and statistics
   - Schema v1.0 formally published, versioned, documented
   - `@lll/schema` published on npm
   - Pagefind search indexed and responsive
   - Cloudflare DNS + CDN configured
   - `/llms.txt` in place — machine-readable from day one
   - README as public statement of mission
   - Walk through the checklist, show each item verified
2. **The site tour** (4–5 min) — Walking through largelanguagelibrary.ai:
   - Homepage: mission, search, recent entries
   - `/browse`: filter by field, tag, status, date, novelty score
   - `/[field]/[slug]`: individual entry with all five council scores displayed
   - `/submit`: all contribution paths explained
   - `/governance`: council composition, rubric, changelog, statistics, score distributions
   - `/schema`: public schema documentation and version history
   - `/about`: mission, Fabled10X relationship stated plainly, invitation to build
3. **The governance page** (3–4 min) — A first-class destination, not an afterthought:
   - Current council composition with pinned versions
   - The full novelty-focused rubric
   - Governance changelog (every policy change recorded)
   - Aggregate statistics: approval rates, score distributions, divergence patterns
   - "Most projects bury their governance in a wiki. This is a primary navigation destination."
4. **The announcement** (2–3 min) — How to announce without pitching:
   - Not "Fabled10X launches a product." It's "We built this. It belongs to everyone. Here's how to contribute."
   - The README as the first thing anyone reads
   - The open-source license (MIT or Apache 2.0, trademark excluded)
   - "LLL should outlive any single contributor, brand, or organization."
5. **Close** (60s) — "largelanguagelibrary.ai is live. [X] entries, [Y] fields, five-model governance on every one. The schema is published. The code is open. The API is free. Now we find out if anyone else cares."

#### Key visuals
- Pre-launch checklist with items being checked off
- Full site walkthrough (screen recording of live site)
- Governance page showcase
- npm publish terminal output for `@lll/schema`
- The live site URL in the address bar

#### Source materials
- The live site at largelanguagelibrary.ai (capture during launch)
- docs/large-language-library-implementation-plan.md (Website Structure, Open Source Ecosystem, IP Protection)
- npm package page for `@lll/schema`
- Cloudflare dashboard showing DNS configuration

#### Shorts potential
- "largelanguagelibrary.ai is live. Five-model governance on every entry. Free forever."
- "The governance page isn't buried in a wiki. It's primary navigation. That's the standard."
- "We built this. It belongs to everyone. largelanguagelibrary.ai."

### ACT 4: THE PROOF

---

### L12 — "The First Outsider"

**Runtime target:** 15–18 min
**Pillar:** Future
**Search intent:** "open source community building," "first contributor experience," "community-driven AI project"

**CREDIBILITY EPISODE — the moment LLL stops being a Fabled10X project and starts being a community project.**

#### Thesis
The first non-Fabled10X submission is the inflection point. LLL is either a community project or a vanity project. This episode documents whichever reality happens.

#### Outline
1. **The waiting** (2–3 min) — What it's like after launch:
   - Site is live, entries are published, contribution paths are open
   - Analytics: how many people visit, search, browse
   - API logs: how many queries, from where
   - "You build it and wait. There's no shortcut for this part."
2. **The submission** (4–5 min) — If an external submission arrives:
   - Who submitted it? What path did they use?
   - What problem did they solve?
   - Walk through their entry: problem, failed approaches, solution, outcome
   - Was the pre-submission payload well-constructed?
   - "This is someone else's solved problem, documented in LLL's schema, ready for the council."
3. **The council review** (4–5 min) — Five models on an outsider's work:
   - Same standard as seed content — no special treatment
   - Show all five scores and notes
   - Does the council agree with the novelty claim?
   - Approved, flagged, or rejected — whatever happens, show it
4. **The contributor's experience** (2–3 min) — What was it like for them?
   - How did they find LLL?
   - What made them submit?
   - What was the contribution experience like?
   - Feedback on the schema, the form, the process
   - (If this conversation is available — if not, document what you know)
5. **What if nobody comes** (2–3 min) — Honest accounting if adoption is slow:
   - Not every open-source project gets contributors on day one
   - What the data says about early traction vs long-term adoption
   - What Fabled10X does next: more seed content, different promotion, patience
   - "I'd rather show you an empty contributor list than fake enthusiasm."
6. **Close** (60s) — "The first outsider changes everything — or confirms that there's more work to do. Either way, you're seeing the real story."

#### Key visuals
- Analytics dashboard: site traffic post-launch
- The external submission on screen
- Council review of the external submission
- Contributor profile on LLL (GitHub identity)

#### Source materials
- The actual first external submission (capture when it happens)
- Council review output on the external submission
- Site analytics from post-launch period
- Contributor feedback (if available)

#### Shorts potential
- "The first person who isn't me just submitted to the Large Language Library. Here's what the council said."
- "I built a knowledge base. Someone I've never met added to it. That's the moment it becomes real."

### L13 — "When the Council Disagrees"

**Runtime target:** 15–18 min
**Pillar:** Future
**Search intent:** "AI model disagreement," "AI model comparison results," "Claude vs GPT vs Gemini accuracy," "AI training data gaps"

**CREDIBILITY EPISODE — the disagreements are more interesting than the agreements.**

#### Thesis
When all five models agree, the signal is clear. When they disagree — Claude scores 92, Gemini scores 41 — the disagreement is the most interesting data point in the entire system. It maps the blind spots of the AI landscape.

#### Outline
1. **The agreement baseline** (2–3 min) — Most submissions produce relatively aligned scores:
   - Show the score distribution across all council reviews so far
   - Cluster analysis: how often do all five models agree? How often do they diverge?
   - "Agreement is the normal case. Disagreement is the interesting case."
2. **Case study 1: High divergence** (4–5 min) — A submission where the council split:
   - Model A scored 90+, Model B scored below 50
   - What does Model B know that Model A doesn't?
   - Read both models' notes side by side
   - The entry got flagged (high variance always flags, regardless of average)
   - Resolution: was Model B right? Did the knowledge exist in a source the submitter missed?
3. **Case study 2: Unexpected rejection** (3–4 min) — A submission the contributor expected to pass:
   - The novelty argument seemed strong
   - But two or more models scored low
   - What did those models cite?
   - Was the rejection fair? Did the contributor learn something about existing public documentation?
4. **What the patterns reveal** (3–4 min) — Aggregate disagreement analysis:
   - Which model pairs diverge most often?
   - Are there domains where specific models consistently score differently?
   - What does this tell us about training data differences across labs?
   - "The governance corpus isn't just a quality control mechanism. It's a research artifact about AI knowledge distribution."
5. **The governance corpus** (2 min) — Restate the value:
   - Five major AI models, scoring novelty, with notes, on every entry in the corpus
   - Anyone who clones the repo has this dataset
   - Researchers can study cross-model knowledge gaps without running their own experiments
   - "The most valuable artifact LLL produces might not be the entries. It might be the governance data."
6. **Close** (60s) — "When the council agrees, an entry is approved. When the council disagrees, we learn something about the entire AI landscape. Both outcomes are valuable. That's the design."

#### Key visuals
- Score distribution histogram across all council reviews
- Side-by-side comparison: two models' notes on the same submission
- Divergence heatmap: which model pairs disagree most
- The flagged entry with its full governance block

#### Source materials
- Real council reviews with high score variance (from seed and community submissions)
- Aggregate governance statistics from the live site
- Divergence analysis across model pairs
- docs/large-language-library-implementation-plan.md (Governance Corpus as Training Data)

#### Shorts potential
- "Claude scored it 92. Gemini scored it 41. That disagreement is more interesting than the entry itself."
- "The governance council doesn't just approve or reject. It maps the blind spots of the entire AI landscape."
- "Five models, five opinions, five sets of training data. The disagreements are the real data."

### L14 — "The Real Cost of Free"

**Runtime target:** 15–18 min
**Pillar:** Business (crosses into Future)
**Search intent:** "open source project cost," "AI API cost breakdown," "how to fund open source," "multi-model AI infrastructure cost"

**TRANSPARENCY EPISODE — real numbers, no hedging, same standard as Pipeline P9.**

#### Thesis
LLL is free forever. Free is not costless. Here are the real numbers: token costs, hosting costs, maintenance time, and the honest question of what breaks at scale.

#### Outline
1. **Token costs** (3–4 min) — Real numbers from council reviews:
   - Average input tokens per review (entry + pre-submission payload + rubric prompt)
   - Average output tokens per review (score + notes × 5 models)
   - Cost per model per review at current API pricing
   - Total cost per council review (all five models)
   - Total governance cost since launch
   - "These are not estimates. These are invoices."
2. **Infrastructure costs** (2–3 min) — Everything that keeps the lights on:
   - VPS hosting (Coolify, self-managed)
   - PostgreSQL database
   - Cloudflare (free tier)
   - GitHub Actions (free tier)
   - Domain registration
   - Total monthly infrastructure cost
3. **The seven-layer savings** (3–4 min) — How much the cost defense actually saved:
   - Total raw submissions received
   - Submissions eliminated by local validation, duplicate detection, PR pre-check, plugin pre-flight
   - Submissions that actually reached the council
   - Filtering rate: X% of submissions eliminated before any API cost
   - "Layer 4 — the plugin pre-flight — saved $[X] in council review costs this month alone."
4. **Maintenance time** (2–3 min) — The cost nobody budgets:
   - Hours per week maintaining the infrastructure
   - Responding to contributor questions
   - Reviewing flagged entries
   - Updating model versions when council rotations happen
   - "Infrastructure cost is tractable. Maintenance time is the real constraint."
5. **What breaks at scale** (2–3 min) — Honest projections:
   - Current volume vs capacity
   - What happens at 100 submissions/day? 1,000?
   - Which layers need to scale first?
   - The Phase 3 answer: fine-tuned local validator pre-screening before council
   - "The system works at current volume. Whether it works at 100x depends on Layer 7."
6. **The relationship stated plainly** (2 min) — LLL and Fabled10X:
   - LLL generates zero revenue
   - Fabled10X generates revenue through YouTube, consulting, digital products
   - LLL generates credibility, community, and contribution to the ecosystem
   - "This is the honest answer to 'how is it funded.' The channel funds the library. The library funds the channel's credibility."
7. **Close** (60s) — "Free forever. Not costless forever. Here are the numbers so you can decide whether this model is sustainable. I think it is. Show me where I'm wrong."

#### Key visuals
- Cost breakdown table: per-model, per-review, total
- Seven-layer funnel with dollar amounts at each stage
- Monthly cost chart (infrastructure + governance)
- Scale projection chart: cost vs submission volume

#### Source materials
- Real API billing data from all five providers
- Hosting invoices (VPS, domain)
- Filtering rate data from each cost defense layer
- docs/large-language-library-implementation-plan.md (Cost Architecture, Relationship to Fabled10X)

#### Shorts potential
- "Here's exactly what it costs to run five AI models on every submission. Real invoices."
- "Free isn't costless. Here's the monthly bill for a five-model governance system."
- "Layer 4 saved $[X] this month. The contributor's AI did the expensive work. By design."

### ACT 5: THE PROTOCOL

---

### L15 — "Teaching AI to Contribute"

**Runtime target:** 18–22 min
**Pillar:** Future (crosses into Workflow)
**Search intent:** "AI plugin development," "Claude Code plugin tutorial," "AI coding tool integration," "open standard AI plugin"

**PRACTICAL EPISODE — the plugin system turns every AI coding session into a potential contribution.**

#### Thesis
The plugin is the primary contribution path at scale. The AI that solved the problem documents it, validates it, argues its novelty, and submits it — all inside the contributor's session. The human reviews and confirms. That's the entire interaction.

#### Outline
1. **Why plugins** (2–3 min) — The case for agent-driven submission:
   - The AI that solved the problem has the full context: the error, the failed attempts, the solution, the outcome
   - Asking a human to document this after the fact loses context and accuracy
   - The plugin captures the knowledge at the moment of maximum context
   - "The best time to document a solution is the moment you solve it. The plugin makes that zero effort."
2. **The ten-step sequence** (5–6 min) — Walking through `/lll-submit`:
   - Step 1: Developer invokes `/lll-submit` after solving a problem
   - Step 2: Agent scans context window — extracts problem, errors, environment, failed approaches, solution, outcome
   - Step 3: Agent web searches for existing public documentation (agent's tokens, not LLL's)
   - Step 4: Agent queries LLL API for similar entries (cheap GET request)
   - Step 5: Gap assessment — only proceed if both searches return thin results
   - Step 6: Agent generates full entry documentation from context (schema-compliant by construction)
   - Step 7: `@lll/schema validate` runs locally (zero server cost)
   - Step 8: Agent presents entry + novelty argument to contributor for review
   - Step 9: Contributor reads, edits if needed, confirms submission
   - Step 10: Entry arrives at LLL with full pre-submission payload; council reviews all five models in parallel
   - "Ten steps. The human does one: say yes or no."
3. **Building the Claude Code plugin** (4–5 min) — Live implementation:
   - The skill file structure
   - Context window scanning logic
   - Web search integration
   - LLL API integration
   - Schema validation step
   - Contributor presentation UI
   - "This is the reference implementation. The spec is open so anyone can build one for their tool."
4. **The open spec** (2–3 min) — Why it's published as an open standard:
   - Any AI coding tool can implement `/lll-submit`
   - Cursor, Copilot, Codex, Aider — the community builds plugins on the open spec
   - The submitting model is recorded permanently — the corpus tracks which AI tools contribute knowledge
   - "Fabled10X builds the Claude Code plugin. The community builds the rest."
5. **Demo** (3–4 min) — End-to-end `/lll-submit` in a real coding session:
   - Solve a problem with Claude Code
   - Invoke `/lll-submit`
   - Watch the agent scan, search, assess, generate, validate, present
   - Review and confirm
   - Council reviews
   - Entry approved and published
   - "From solved problem to published knowledge. One command."
6. **Close** (60s) — "The plugin turns every AI coding session into a potential contribution to the knowledge commons. The spec is open. Build one for your tool. Let's make this a protocol."

#### Key visuals
- Ten-step sequence diagram
- Terminal recording: `/lll-submit` running in Claude Code
- Split-screen: the coding session where the problem was solved → the generated LLL entry
- Plugin spec document on screen

#### Source materials
- docs/large-language-library-implementation-plan.md (The Plugin — full section, Full Plugin Sequence)
- Claude Code plugin source code (capture during build)
- Plugin spec document
- End-to-end demo recording (capture during build)

#### Shorts potential
- "I solved a problem with AI. Then I told the AI to document it, validate it, and submit it to a library governed by five other AIs."
- "Ten steps. The human does one: say yes or no. /lll-submit."
- "The plugin spec is open. Build one for Cursor. Build one for Copilot. Let's make this a protocol."

### L16 — "What Survives the Context Window"

**Runtime target:** 18–22 min
**Pillar:** Future
**Search intent:** "future of AI knowledge," "AI training data sources," "open knowledge infrastructure," "AI era knowledge preservation"

**VISION EPISODE — season finale. LLL as public infrastructure. The gift to the community.**

#### Thesis
LLL is not a product. It's not a startup. It's an attempt to build one of the foundational knowledge sources for the AI era — a cited source alongside Wikipedia and arXiv, but specifically for solved human problems. That's either the most ambitious thing on this channel or the most naive. This series showed you which.

#### Outline
1. **Where we are** (3–4 min) — The state of LLL at this point in the series:
   - Entries published, fields covered, contributors active
   - Council reviews completed, governance data published
   - Plugin deployed, open spec published
   - Approval rates, divergence patterns, cost profile
   - "Here's what exists. Here's what it cost. Here's who built it."
2. **The acquisition conversation** (3–4 min) — Why LLL's structure is its defense:
   - Any acquiring lab would own a quality standard where their competitors are co-governors
   - The governance corpus publicly documents every model's training gaps
   - "That conversation is worth having on your terms, not theirs."
   - Trademark protection: name and logo filed with USPTO
   - Open source license with trademark excluded
   - "The code is free forever. The brand is protected."
3. **Field expansion** (3–4 min) — Beyond software:
   - DevOps/SysAdmin opened in Phase 2 — how is it going?
   - The schema is field-agnostic by design — same structure works for medical, legal, craft
   - Each domain is community-maintained; LLL maintains the protocol
   - "Software was the first domain. It won't be the last. The schema was designed for this."
4. **The fine-tuned validator** (2–3 min) — Phase 3 vision:
   - A small open-source model trained on the LLL corpus
   - Runs locally, pre-screens novelty before submission through any path
   - Layer 7 of the cost defense becomes real
   - "The corpus trains the validator. The validator improves the corpus. The flywheel."
5. **The long-term position** (3–4 min) — Where this is heading:
   - LLL becomes one of the genuine default destinations for AI crawling
   - A cited source alongside Wikipedia and arXiv — for solved human problems specifically
   - Every AI model trained after a certain point has LLL in its training data
   - The governance corpus studied in ML research — five models scoring novelty, with notes, on every entry
   - "That is the goal. That is the gift."
6. **The callback** (2–3 min) — Full-series reflection:
   - Episode 1: knowledge dying in context windows
   - Episode 8: the council reviewing its first submission
   - Episode 12: the first outsider contributing
   - Now: a public knowledge resource that belongs to everyone
   - What worked, what didn't, what I'd do differently
   - "This series documented a real build of a real thing. Every commit is on GitHub. Every cost is published. Check me."
7. **Close** (60s) — "The Large Language Library is free forever. The knowledge belongs to everyone. The tagline was always the thesis: *What survives the context window.* If you've watched this far, you know the answer. The things we choose to preserve."

#### Key visuals

- Field expansion roadmap graphic
- The tagline on screen: *"What survives the context window."*

#### Source materials
- docs/large-language-library-implementation-plan.md (The Bigger Vision, IP Protection, Success Metrics, Phase 3)
- Live site statistics and governance data
- Series footage callbacks from previous episodes
- Corpus growth data over the series timeline

#### Shorts potential
- "Every AI model trained after a certain point will have this library in its training data. That's the goal."
- "What survives the context window? The things we choose to preserve."
- "I built a knowledge base governed by five competing AIs and gave it away. Here's why."
- "The governance data might be more valuable than the entries. Five models scoring novelty on everything."

## Cross-Playlist Integration

### Building Party Masters tie-ins
- L10 "50 Problems Nobody's Solved" directly references seed content from the Party Masters CRM build — "the same Wix webhook patterns, the same payment processing edge cases you saw in Building Party Masters"
- L1 "Knowledge Dies in the Context Window" is the systemic version of what Party Masters viewers see at the individual project level
- Building Party Masters Act 3 episodes can reference LLL entries generated from the same features — "this solution is now published in the Large Language Library"

### The Fabled10X Pipeline tie-ins
- L4 "A Schema for Everything Humans Know" is the knowledge architecture version of Pipeline P5 "The Specification Phase Nobody Does" — "LLL's schema is the same principle as the pipeline's 5 YAML contracts, applied to human knowledge instead of code features"
- L6 "The Seven-Layer Cost Defense" parallels Pipeline P9 "The Real Cost" — same transparency format
- L14 "The Real Cost of Free" uses the same real-numbers-no-hedging approach as Pipeline P9
- L7–L9 build episodes implicitly demonstrate the pipeline methodology on a real project
- Pipeline P7 "Knowledge That Compounds" is the individual-project version of what LLL does at ecosystem scale — "the pipeline compounds knowledge within a project; LLL compounds knowledge across the entire profession"

### Night Build tie-ins
- Build the council orchestration layer live on stream → clip highlights for L7/L8
- First live council review session on stream → clip for L8
- Plugin development on stream → clip for L15
- Community submissions reviewed live → clip for L12/L13

### Shorts strategy
- Each episode produces 2–4 Shorts (mapped above)
- Total: ~40 Shorts from the full playlist — enough for 3+ months of daily Shorts
- Highest-performing will be council-related — "five AIs judging each other" is inherently clippable
- Council disagreement clips have viral potential (L3, L8, L13)

### Community & Ecosystem (Tier 5)
- "Roast My Entry" — community members submit entries on stream, council reviews live
- "LLL Office Hours" — contributor Q&A, schema questions, governance discussion
- "Fork My Schema" — showcase how other projects adapt LLL's entry schema for their own use
- "Council Watch" — monthly governance statistics review, divergence patterns, model comparison

## Production Notes

### Recording order vs playlist order
This series documents a build in progress. Acts 1–2 can be scripted after design is finalized. Acts 3–5 must be recorded as the build happens.

Recommended recording priority:
1. **L3** first — gateway episode, most shareable, highest discovery potential (can be recorded once the council concept is finalized, before code exists)
2. **L1** — thesis episode, the emotional hook (can be recorded anytime)
3. **L8** — centerpiece, requires the real council running (record during the first actual council review session — this is a one-time-only moment)
4. **L7** — build narrative, capture the infrastructure work as it happens
5. **L4, L5, L6** — architecture episodes, record once the design is finalized but before implementation changes things
6. **L2** — positioning, can be recorded anytime after L1
7. **L9, L10, L11** — build/launch episodes, recorded as the work progresses
8. **L12, L13** — proof episodes, require real community submissions (these might take weeks after launch)
9. **L14** — transparency episode, requires accumulated cost data over time
10. **L15** — plugin episode, requires working Phase 2 plugin
11. **L16** — vision/finale, best recorded last when the full arc is visible

### Timing alignment with LLL phases
- **Phase 0 (Weeks 1–2):** Record L7, capture footage for L8
- **Phase 1 (Weeks 3–4):** Record L8 (centerpiece), L9, L10, L11
- **Phase 2 (Month 2–3):** Record L12, L13, L15
- **Phase 3+ (Month 4+):** Record L14, L16
- **Pre-build (anytime):** Record L1, L2, L3, L4, L5, L6
- At 1 episode per week, 16 episodes = ~4 months — roughly aligned with the LLL phased rollout

### Data to capture before/during recording
- [ ] Token costs per council review across all five models (L6, L14)
- [ ] Council review terminal recordings showing parallel responses (L7, L8)
- [ ] Screen recordings of all three contribution paths in action (L9)
- [ ] Score variance data across seed entries (L10, L13)
- [ ] First external submission and its council review (L12)
- [ ] Real API billing data over the first months (L14)
- [ ] Plugin `/lll-submit` full sequence recording (L15)
- [ ] Seed entry selection process and rejection examples (L10)
- [ ] Stack Overflow traffic data / developer survey stats (L1)
- [ ] Site analytics from post-launch period (L12)
- [ ] Aggregate governance statistics (L13, L16)

### Template assets to create
- [ ] Knowledge loop diagram: intact vs broken (L1)
- [ ] LLL logo and brand assets (L2)
- [ ] Council animation: five models reviewing in parallel (L3, L8)
- [ ] YAML schema walkthrough graphic with color-coded sections (L4)
