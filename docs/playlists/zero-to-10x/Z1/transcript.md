## 1 · Cold open — the state of the landscape

*[Slides 1–5]*

Should you still learn to code in 2026?

That's the question this curriculum is built around. Forty episodes. Free. Sequenced the way Professor Messer would sequence it — if he'd picked AI development instead of IT certifications.

Before we go anywhere else, let me tell you what changed.

Three years ago, the answer to "should you learn to code" was a hesitant yes. Bootcamps were expensive. Most of them were already outdated. But if you wanted a job as a developer, you still needed to type code that worked, and the only way to get there was to learn to type code that worked.

Then March 2023 happened. GPT-4 shipped. By late 2024, Claude 3 and Gemini were mainstream. By 2025, Cursor and Claude Code were how professional developers actually worked. And right now, in 2026, a single prompt produces a working feature in about the time it takes to pour a coffee.

Let me show you what I mean.

*[Roll demo clip — Slide 5]*

That's me, about an hour before I recorded this episode. I typed "build me a todo app with a database in Next.js" into Cursor. Two minutes later, I had a running application. Deployed. Accepting input. Saving to a real database. No keystrokes from me. Just a prompt and a few approvals.

So the obvious question is: if AI does that, why learn at all?

And the obvious answer — the one the hype accounts give you on TikTok — is "you don't. Just learn to prompt." That answer is wrong.

Here's what the demo doesn't show you. I read every file AI produced before I approved it. I caught three subtle mistakes. A race condition in the database writer. A missing null check that would've crashed the app on an empty list. An auth route that would've let anyone delete anyone else's todos. I fixed the scope: it built three features I hadn't asked for and skipped one I had. I made a call about which framework to use because AI, left to itself, would have picked differently.

The demo took two minutes. The judgment took six.

AI is an enormously powerful assistant. It is not a developer. **Being a developer in 2026 means being the person who directs it, reviews it, and catches what it got wrong.**

That's a real skill. It is teachable. And almost nothing online actually teaches it.

That's why this exists.

## 2 · Why this curriculum is free

*[Slides 10–11]*

So why am I doing this for free?

Because the best technical educator on the internet, for over a decade, has been a guy named James Messer. Professor Messer. He teaches people how to pass their CompTIA IT certifications. A+, Network+, Security+. And his model is this: every course video, free, on YouTube. No paywall on the fundamentals.

He has been right about this for ten straight years. A million subscribers later, he's still right.

So I'm stealing his model.

There is no paywall on these forty episodes. There will never be a paywall on these forty episodes. You can watch them in any order. You can share them with anyone. You can use them at a bootcamp, a high school, a job transition program, a prison education initiative — I genuinely do not care how you use them. Take them. They're yours.

I make money elsewhere. Consulting engagements where teams pay me to help them actually do this. Tools for people who want leverage on top of the fundamentals. Cohorts and office hours for people who want hands-on feedback. Those exist. If you want them, great. But none of that is gatekept behind this curriculum.

The fundamentals belong to the public. The people who hide the fundamentals are wrong about what education is supposed to do.

## 3 · What you'll be able to do at Z40

*[Slide 12]*

OK. Concrete promise time. What can you actually do after watching all forty of these?

Five things.

**One.** You will be able to build and deploy a real, working web application, end-to-end, by yourself. Frontend. Backend. Database. Deployed to the internet. The app we build in Act 4 is not a toy. It lives on a real URL. It accepts real users. It stores their real data. You will have shipped it.

**Two.** You will be able to read AI-generated code critically. You will know when the code is doing something subtly wrong. You'll catch the race conditions, the missing null checks, the weird async handling, the silently dropped errors. This is the single biggest differentiator between someone who "uses AI" and someone who's actually good with AI. Most people never learn it.

**Three.** You will be able to debug. Specifically — and this matters — you'll be able to debug the kinds of bugs that AI tends to produce. They are different from the bugs humans produce. AI bugs are often syntactically beautiful and semantically nonsense. Recognizing them is a learned skill. Act 5 is mostly about this.

**Four.** You will be able to make architectural decisions. You'll know when to use a relational database versus a key-value store. You'll know when to reach for a framework versus when a framework is overkill. You'll know what "separation of concerns" actually means — not because I made you memorize a definition, but because you will have made the wrong call, felt the pain, and corrected it.

**Five.** You will be able to work professionally as a developer in 2026. Which means — and I want to be precise here — you will be someone who uses AI as leverage. Not someone being replaced by it.

The people being replaced by AI are the people who could only do what AI can do. If you finish this curriculum, you will be able to do what AI can't: judge, decide, review, scope, lead.

Those are the five outcomes. Every episode in this curriculum points at one or more of them. If an episode doesn't point at one of them, it's not in this curriculum.

## 4 · What this won't do

*[Slide 13]*

Now let me be equally honest about what this won't do.

This won't make you a senior engineer. Seniority is years of scar tissue. It's the muscle memory of fifteen production incidents, three bad architecture decisions you now regret, and one quarter where you were the on-call lead and learned things you wish you hadn't. You do not get that from a playlist. You get it from time. This curriculum gets you to *proficient*. Not *senior*.

This won't make you a specialist. Specialization is depth, and depth requires focus. If you want to be an expert in machine learning infrastructure, or distributed databases, or iOS animations, you'll need to go deep on one thing after this. That's a different path. This curriculum is the foundation. Specialization is what you build on top of it.

This won't guarantee you a job. I cannot promise you employment. Nobody honest can. The market is what the market is — some years it's great for juniors, other years it isn't. What this curriculum does is make you the kind of person who can do the job. Whether someone hires you is a separate thing involving your portfolio, your network, your interviewing, and market conditions on the day you apply. All of that is downstream of being able to actually do the work. We're focused on the upstream part.

And this won't replace building real things. You cannot watch your way to proficiency. Forty episodes will not make you a developer. Forty episodes *plus practice* might. You have to build stuff. You have to ship stuff. You have to feel the frustration of something breaking in production at eleven at night. That's non-negotiable. I'll point you at exercises in every episode. Whether you actually do them is the difference between watching a curriculum and learning from it.

OK. Those are the honest limits. Moving on.

## 5 · The curriculum map

*[Slides 14–20]*

Here's the whole map.

Six acts. Forty episodes. Fifteen to twenty-five minutes each.

**Act 1 is orientation.** Five episodes. You're in it right now. We cover what code actually is, what AI changed, the mental models that still matter, and setting up your environment from nothing. By the end of Act 1 you'll know what game we're playing.

**Act 2 is the tools.** Five episodes. Terminal, editor, git, browser devtools, and the AI coding tools you'll use for the rest of your career — Cursor, Claude Code, whatever replaces them by the time you're watching this. This is the equivalent of a carpenter's first week: learning where everything is in the shop before you pick up a saw.

**Act 3 is the fundamentals.** Eight episodes. Variables, functions, data structures, control flow, state, errors, async. Every concept gets taught *twice*: once watching AI write it, once reviewing what AI wrote. Both skills are necessary. Neither is optional.

**Act 4 is your first app.** Eight episodes. We build a real application, end-to-end. Frontend, backend, database, deployed. You will have built and shipped something real by the end of Act 4. It'll be small. It'll be ugly. And it will live on the internet.

**Act 5 is the judgment layer.** This is the important one.

Let me stop and say this clearly. This is the act that most courses skip entirely, and it is why most graduates of other courses can't get past "I can build a todo app." Act 5 is eight episodes on debugging what AI got subtly wrong, making architecture decisions, scoping what to build, and all the hard qualitative skills that AI cannot yet do for you. I'm going to point at this act now and ask you to remember it exists. When you get there, pay the most attention.

The judgment layer is where developers actually get made.

**Act 6 is the 10X moment.** Six episodes. This is where you stop being someone who uses AI and become someone who manages AI. Running multiple agents at once. Multi-agent workflows. The full Fabled10X Pipeline as your graduation project.

"10X" is not a personality trait. It's what happens when a person with good judgment gets leverage they didn't have before. Act 6 is where you get the leverage.

That's the map.

## 6 · How to use this curriculum

*[Slide 21]*

Four rules for using this curriculum.

**One. Watch in order.** I designed these to build on each other. You can skip around if you want. The episodes are standalone enough that you'll get something out of any individual one. But if you skip, you're going to miss threads I'm pulling through the whole series. Sequential is the intended path.

**Two. Practice in parallel.** There is a companion exercise for every episode. The link is in the description. If you watch all forty episodes without doing any of the exercises, you won't be a developer — you'll be a person who has watched forty videos about development. Those are not the same thing.

**Three. Use the companion repo.** I'm publishing the repo with starter code, exercises, and answer keys. Fork it. Break things. The answer keys are for when you're genuinely stuck — not for copying.

**Four. Talk to other people learning this.** The community discussion happens — venue is linked in the description. Learning next to other people is a force multiplier. Not technically required. Strongly recommended.

## 7 · Close

*[Slide 22]*

That's Z1.

Forty episodes from here. Free forever. I'm going to teach you what being a developer in 2026 actually means — not what the bootcamp marketing tells you it means, not what the AI hype accounts promise on TikTok, not what an outdated CS curriculum covered ten years ago.

This is the training I wish I'd had. I'm going to give it to you.

Next up: Z2 — *What Code Actually Is*. We're going to strip the mystery off programming and get to the one-sentence definition that every developer agrees on. Fifteen minutes. Worth your time.

Thanks for being here.

Let's go.
